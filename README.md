# NPCgenerator
A quick and simple, yet thorough random NPC generator I whipped up for a friend's Cyberpunk D&amp;D campaign.
# This is meant to be run in command prompt with >python NPCgenerator.py

I got all of the information I used from Cyberpunk: The Roleplaying Game of the Dark Future, copyright 1990, 1991, 1993 by R. Talsorian Games, Inc.
ISBN: 0-937-279-13-7

Started on 1-14-21, first version completed 1-20-21
Version 1.1: added gender specifier
Version 2.0: redesigned and fixed female name bug

Input: number of NPCs, class specifier, gender specifier

Output: first name, last name, class, 12 randomly generated stats, armor/weapon selection, saving throw,
body type modifier, special ability, education level, randomly selected cybernetics, styles, and motivations,
and 9 skills which use a budgeting system to distribute 40 points among them, with no less than 2 and no greater 
than 10 in each.
